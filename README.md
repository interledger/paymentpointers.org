# Payment Pointers

This is the source code for the website hosted at [paymentpointers.org](https://paymentpointers.org). It is built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/), a documentation framework based on [Astro](https://astro.build/). The RFC for payment pointers can be found [here](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0026-payment-pointers/0026-payment-pointers.md).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
