# Payment Pointers

This is the source code for the website hosted at [paymentpointers.org](https://paymentpointers.org). It is built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/), a documentation framework based on [Astro](https://astro.build/). The RFC for payment pointers can be found [here](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0026-payment-pointers/0026-payment-pointers.md).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Static assets, like favicons or images, can be placed in the `public/` directory. When referencing these assets in your markdown, you do not have to include `public/` in the file path, so an image would have a path like:

```md
![A lovely description of your beautiful image](/img/YOUR_BEAUTIFUL_IMAGE.png)
```

## Local development

We are using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) in this repository, but you could theoretically use the package manager of your choice. To install Bun, run

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun run start`           | Starts local dev server at `localhost:1102`      |
| `bun run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

You can substitute the `bun` commands with whatever package manager of your choice uses.
